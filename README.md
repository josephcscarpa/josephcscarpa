**I am not actively seeking new positions.** Résumé available upon request.

## What I'm working on in 2024-2025
- Becoming a better developer by learning how to manage problems of immense scqale and ambiguity.

## Education
**Duke University**  
*August 2020 -- May 2024*  
Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, Bachelor of Arts in Music (Organ Performance).

## <a name="music-section">Music</a>

I have extensive musical experience -- BA in Organ Performance, worked as supply organist since 2018 at churches of all sizes, received a choral scholarship at Duke Chapel, former member of Duke's professional Evensong and Bach choirs, former member of St. Agnes Cathedral Boys Choir, former boy soprano at NY City Opera. 

Once I've worked out more immediate matters in my life, I plan on preparing a recital every here. I'll be posting information on those here. 

### Hire an organist
If you are in the Bay Area, I am booked on Sunday mornings until May 2025 with limited openings for Saturdays, Special Feasts. I have *very* limited availability for NY churches during Advent IV/Christmastide. If you are interested, and we haven't worked together before, please include the honorarium in your email. I am working on a digital scheduler soon. 

### Project Fugue
I am working on some collections of fugues for organ and maybe piano on themes from famous classical compositions, which I hope to make publically available in 2026.
